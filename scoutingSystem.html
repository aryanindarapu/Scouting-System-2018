				<p>OVERVIEW OF GAME</p>
				<br></br>
				<p> In the FIRST Robotics Competition, teams are trapped in an 8-bit video game. Each three-team alliance has three ways to help defeat the boss: 
					Tipping the scale or the allianceâ€™s switch in their favor to earn points, exchanging power cubes for power ups (force, boost, and levitate) 
					to gain a temporary advantage during the match, and climbing the scale tower to face the boss. The alliance with the highest score at the end of the match, 
					which includes autonomous and teleoperated periods, defeats the boss and wins the game.
				<br></br>
				<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>AUTON</p>
				<br></br>
				<p> While scouting auton, there are multiple factors one must observe to scout correctly. As soon as the game starts, look at the robot and observe if they crossed the baseline.
					Next, one must observe if the robot puts a cube is placed on a scale or switch. If so, check the boxes to the left.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>PENALTIES</p>
				<br></br>
				<p> At the end of the game, fouls and technical fouls may be assessed. If any fouls are assessed, please mark how many fouls. 
					If any yellow fouls are made, check mark the box to the left. If there is a red card assessed, then also check the box to the left.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>ENDGAME</p>
				<br></br>
				<p> During the final 30 seconds of play, robots will have an opportunity to climb and scale the tower.</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>Submit</p>
				<br></br>
				<p> The final tab is submit. If there are any notes or specialties about the robot, please mark it in the comments box. Thank You!</p>
