Rykers notes:
restrict clickable block spaces by team color (can't cross half auton, can't get/deliver to other teams station and portals . . .)
--keep track of team name and color on every tab screen
--fix wording of end game and change to radio buttons
--next/previous buttons on sides to go between tabs
--Instructions button has to link to actual instructions page
