Rykers notes:
restrict clickable block spaces by team color (can't cross half auton, can't get/deliver to other teams station and portals . . .)
keep track of team name and color on every tab screen
fix wording of end game and change to radio buttons
clicking a position button again undoes the position auton
next/previous buttons on sides to go between tabs
